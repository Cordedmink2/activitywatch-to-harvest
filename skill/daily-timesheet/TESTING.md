# Testing & Improvement Record

Not part of the operating instructions. `SKILL.md` says what to do; this file holds
why it says it — test records, settled decisions with their evidence, and the options
that were considered and rejected. Read this before changing `SKILL.md`; skip it if
you are just running a timesheet.

Method: `changing-agent-instructions`. The rule that governs this file is **never
encode a diagnosis you have not watched happen**.

## What the instruments measure

`tests/` measures the *scripts*. It stays green when the instructions break, so it is
not the instrument for a `SKILL.md` change — it only guards against a doc edit that
invalidates a script path or command shape (`test_references.py`).

For guidance changes the instrument is: same scenario, fresh agent, no filesystem
access, before vs after, 3+ reps read by hand. Variance across reps is the signal — three
different confident answers means the wording binds nothing.

**No such baseline exists yet.** The changes below were made from live observation of a
single real run, not from a measured before/after. This directory is not a git repo, so
the pre-change text is not recoverable for a retrospective control arm. Capture a
baseline before the next round.

## Evidence rungs

Used below, strongest first:

1. **Observed failure** — the run failed, and the failure was the doc's.
2. **Observed hazard** — the underlying fact was measured, but no agent was watched
   getting it wrong.
3. **Reasoned** — neither. Should not reach `SKILL.md` without a test.

## Settled decisions

### Interpreter is resolved, not literal — `SKILL.md` "Running the scripts"
**Rung 1.** 2026-08-11. Every documented command read `python scripts/…`; on this
machine `python` is the Windows Store app-execution stub, which prints a help message
about installing from the Store and exits **49**. First script call of the run failed.
The exit-49-plus-help-text signature reads like a broken script, so the risk is
debugging the wrong thing.

Fix names the failure signature and points at `.context.md` for the machine's answer.

**Rejected: globally replacing `python` with `py`.** That is the same defect aimed
somewhere else — `py` is Windows-only and would break the skill for any other user.
Machine-specific facts belong in `.context.md` → Machine, which is where this one went.

### Capture-health check at index time — `SKILL.md` Step 3
**Rung 1.** 2026-08-11, billing 2026-08-10. The screenshot task had been dead since
13:32 (scheduled task pointed at `C:\Python314\pythonw.exe`; Python had been reinstalled
to `AppData` at 13:33, so every trigger failed `0x80070002` silently). The index was
listed at Step 3 and the gap was *not* noticed. It surfaced only at Step 5, when the
13:48–17:19 block turned ambiguous and the documented fallback — "then screenshots" —
turned out to be unavailable for exactly that span. The block shipped 🔸 to the user.

The disambiguating fact is that a short index looks identical whether the user stopped
working or the capture died; `work_end` separates the two and is already in hand at
Step 3. Cost of missing it is a block that could have been resolved becoming a question.

Deliberately *not* a "go fix the scheduler" instruction — that is maintenance, and
mixing it into a timesheet run is how a classification task turns into a yak shave.

### Skeleton freshness in the pre-post checklist — `SKILL.md` Step 8
**Rung 2 — weakest of the three, treat as provisional.** 2026-08-11. The session began
2026-08-10 19:37 and resumed the next morning. `work_end` moved 19:46 → 22:36, a new
22:34–22:36 active span appeared, and total active minutes moved 432.2 → 434.6, changing
the coverage denominator.

The hazard is measured. The *skip* is not: the skeleton was re-read spontaneously,
because an overnight resumption is an unmistakable cue. The untested case is the subtle
one — a long same-day session where the day is still open and nothing signals staleness.

**Test before keeping.** If a fresh agent re-reads the skeleton unprompted in the
same-day case, delete this line rather than leave a rule earning nothing.

### `--cover` takes posted entries, not billable ones — `SKILL.md` Step 8
**Rung 1, minor.** The guard said "proposed billed entries", disambiguated only by a
parenthetical. On this run `--cover` was first passed a stretch that was being
*excluded* (personal/tooling time), which is precisely the input that makes the guard
report clean while under-billing goes unnoticed — the failure it exists to catch. Re-run
was needed. Reworded to "every entry Step 9 will post, non-billable ones included", with
the explicit prohibition on feeding excluded stretches to `--cover`.

The rule has **two copies** — Step 6 guard 3 (which owns the explanation and the example
command) and the Step 8 checklist line. Fixing only the checklist copy left them saying
different things — "billed entries" vs "every entry posted" — which is the scope-drift
shape: each reads fine alone, the contradiction only exists across them, and the *unfixed*
copy was the one read first. Both are now aligned; Step 6 owns the reasoning and Step 8
restates the check. A diff self-grep caught exclusivity claims but not this, because it
searched for a phrase rather than for the rule's other copy. **Search for the rule, not the
wording.**

## Rejected

- **A rule about `harvest_list.py` argument shape.** The flags `--from/--to` were
  guessed and failed; the script takes positional dates. But `SKILL.md` already
  documents the positional form in two places. The doc was right and went unread —
  adding a third statement rewards not reading, and grows the doc for nothing. What the
  agent already gets right from existing text needs no rule.
- **Global `python` → `py`.** See above.

## Open gaps

- No fresh-agent baseline for any of the above. The three `SKILL.md` changes are
  unvalidated against a control.
- The Step 8 skeleton-freshness line is rung 2 and may be unnecessary; it has a
  deletion condition written into its entry.
- `tests/` has no coverage asserting `SKILL.md`'s *behavioural* claims, and by the
  method above it never usefully will — don't add doc-behaviour assertions there.
